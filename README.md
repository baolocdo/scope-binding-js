In this code, `monica` is an object that contains 2 properties and a function `addToBalance`. Find a way to use `monica`'s `addToBalance` for object `rachel` without creating a new object. The function `rachelAddToBalance` should use object `rachel` and the constant variable `fee` that are already defined. When calling the following
`rachelAddToBalance()`;

It should return
`"Rachel Green remaining balance is 1700"`
instead of
`'Monica Geller remaining balance is 500'`
